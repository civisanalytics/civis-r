## A (Very) Quick Start

To begin, make sure `civis` is installed and your
[API key is in your R environment](https://civisanalytics.github.io/civis-r/#installation).
You can quickly test that `civis` is working by invoking

```{r, eval=FALSE}
name <- civis::users_list_me()$name
paste(name, "is really awesome!")
```

If `civis` is working, you'll see a friendly message.  Otherwise, you might see an
error like this when `civis` wasn't installed properly:

```
Error in loadNamespace(name) : there is no package called 'civis'
```

or like this if you haven't set your API key correctly:

```
Error in api_key() : The environmental variable CIVIS_API_KEY is not set. Add this to your .Renviron or call Sys.setenv(CIVIS_API_KEY = '<api_key>')
```

With `civis`, moving data to and from the cloud takes only a few lines of code.
Your data can be stored as rows in a table, CSVs on remote file system or even
as serialized R objects like nested lists.  For example,

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(civis)

# First we'll load a dataframe of the famous iris dataset
data(iris)

# We'll set a default database and define the table where want to
# store our data
options(civis.default_db = "my_database")
iris_tablename <- "my_schema.my_table"

# Next we'll push the data to the database table
write_civis(iris, iris_tablename)

# Great, now let's read it back
df <- read_civis(iris_tablename)

# Hmmm, I'm more partial to setosa myself. Let's write a custom sql query.
# We'll need to wrap our query string in `sql` to let read_civis know we
# are passing in a sql command rather than a tablename.
query_str <- paste("SELECT * FROM", iris_tablename, "WHERE Species = 'setosa'")
iris_setosa <- read_civis(sql(query_str))

# Now let's store this data along with a note as a serialized R object
# on a remote file system. We could store any object remotely this way.
data <- list(data = iris_setosa, special_note = "The best iris species")
file_id <- write_civis_file(data)

# Finally, let's read back our data from the remote file system.
data2 <- read_civis(file_id)
data2[["special_note"]]

## [1] "The best iris species"
```

`civis` also includes functionality for working with CivisML, Civis' machine
learning ecosystem.  With the combined power of CivisML and `civis`, you can build
models in the cloud where the models can use as much memory as they need and
thereâ€™s no chance of your laptop crashing.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(civis)

# It really is a great dataset
data(iris)

# Gradient boosting or random forest, who will win?
gb_model <- civis_ml_gradient_boosting_classifier(iris, "Species")
rf_model <- civis_ml_random_forest_classifier(iris, "Species")
macroavgs <- list(gb_model = gb_model$metrics$metrics$roc_auc_macroavg,
                  rf_model = rf_model$metrics$metrics$roc_auc_macroavg)
macroavgs

## $gb_model
## [1] 0.9945333
## 
## $rf_model
## [1] 0.9954667
```

For a comprehensive list of functions in `civis`, see
[Reference](https://civisanalytics.github.io/civis-r/reference/index.html) in the [full
documentation](https://civisanalytics.github.io/civis-r).  The full documentation also
includes a set of `Articles` for detailed documentation on common workflows, including
[data manipulation](https://civisanalytics.github.io/civis-r/articles/data_import_and_export.html) and [building models in parallel](https://civisanalytics.github.io/civis-r/articles/concurrency.html).
